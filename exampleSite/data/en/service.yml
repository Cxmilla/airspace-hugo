  title: What is the Digital Engineering Minor?
  content: "The digital minor blends program-specific knowledge with skills that will allow students to exploit high-technology systems, cyber-physical systems, work with Internet of Things, data analytics and apply machine learning, and information systems in their discipline using Python.

    \n\n **Why Join Digital?**
    \n\nIncreasingly, engineers are required to work with computer, information,
    and digital technology as part of fulfilling their role on projects. No matter
    what an engineerâ€™s major area is whether it is chemical, oil and gas, civil, electrical,
    software, geomatics, mechanical, there is a growing expectation that these professionals
    are able to enhance and augment their focus with specialized knowledge of such
    technologies. \n\nStudies have suggested that there exist a severe shortage of
    engineers having digital skill sets. This minor aims to address this shortage
    and equip graduating engineers with valuable and in-demand digital skills. 
    \n\n **Who Can Take the Digital Minor?**
    \n\n If you are majoring in Mechanical, Civil, Geomatics, Chemical, Electrical, or Biomedical Engineering, you are eligible to take the digital minor.
    \n\n **How many courses will digital add to my program?**
    \n\n Mechanical, Electrical, and Chemical Engineering students will take a total of 2 extra classes. Civil and Biomedical Engineering students will take 3 extra classes. Geomatics Engineering students will take 4 extra classes.
    \n\n **What Courses Do Digital Students Take?**
    \n\n ENDG310: Learning Principles of Software Design with Python, Python libraries, HTML & CSS, Data analysis and visualization
    \n\n ENDG311: Practical software applications (GLI, GUIs, Websites), Advanced topics (object oriented programming, concurrent programming, socket programming, etc.)
    \n\n ENDG410: Machine Learning fundamentals and applications using libraries (SciKit Learn), Supervised and unsupervised learning
    \n\n ENDG411: Advanced AI topics (fastai & pytorch libraries), Computer vision and image classification, Natural Language Processing
    \n\n ENDG511: Fundamentals of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Systems, Convolutional neural networks, Transfer learning, Optimizing processes through pruning & quantization
    \n\n ENDG510: Fundamental principles for designing cyber-physical systems, Cyber security & reliability, Simulating IoT systems"
