  title: Develop a rich understanding of digital engineering - an in-demand skill
    set in an ever-expanding digital world.
  content: "Increasingly, engineers are required to work with computer, information,
    and digital technology as part of fulfilling their role on projects. No matter
    what an engineerâ€™s major area is whether it is chemical, oil and gas, civil, electrical,
    software, geomatics, mechanical, there is a growing expectation that these professionals
    are able toenhance and augment their focus with specialized knowledge of such
    technologies. \n\nStudies have suggested that there exist a severe shortage of
    engineers having digital skill sets. This minor aims to address this shortage
    and equip graduating engineers with valuable and in-demand digital skills. "
