The Digital Engineering Students' Society held a friendly hackathon involving programming the Nanoleaf panels in ICT! Six teams competed in coding the panels and showcased amazing displays. We congratulate all participants on their quick and creative coding. Keep an eye out for future hackathons hosted by DESS!
