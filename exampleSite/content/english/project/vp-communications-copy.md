# Description

Hello! My name is Shulamit and I'm the president of DESS. I'm in my final year of Mechanical Engineering (with a minor in Digital Engineering, of course!). DESS has contributed to some of my best university memories, and I'm eager to provide the same meaningful experiences to other students as well. Some of my favourite past DESS events include the Minor Olympics, the Nanoleaf Hackathon, and the 5 Minute Z Games Challenges. Please feel free to reach out to me if you ever need anything or have a suggestion on how to make DESS better.   
  
Fun fact about me? I love trying new things and going to new places. In the past year, I've learned fencing, hang-gliding, and travelled to 2 new countries!
