# Description

Hey, I'm Camilla! I'm a mechanical engineering student minoring in digital engineering, currently in my internship year at Tesla in California. I'm on UofC's rowing team and love doing stuff in the outdoors! A fun fact about me is that I once got suspended from elementary school.   
As tech commissioner, I'll be keeping the website up to date and be the main point of contact for tech-related inquiries!
